E X A M P L E S :

 Abnormally long running jobs (e.g. 24+ hours)
Impact: can indicate ABAP program inefﬁciency or issues within the system, potentially causing resource contention and affecting overall system performance.
 Multiple parallel job executions(the same job)
Impact: depletion of critical resources such as work processes, memory, and CPU, leading to potential performance bottlenecks and system instability
 Redundant Jobs (jobs with identical or similar structure) Impact: can lead to increased resource consumption, such as additional memory, CPU usage, and disk space, potential confusion for administrators and users, and increased maintenance overhead

 Jobs that already are or will soon become obsolete Explanation: jobs with expired date/time variant values or jobs which’s steps are assigned to the users with ended (or ending) validity
 Deleted Jobs (deleted by user or by program) Impact: possible fraud, potential data loss, disruption of scheduled processes, and challenges in tracking and auditing system activities
 Elongated Jobs (run longer and longer over time) Impact: potential performance bottlenecks, resource contention, and delays in critical business processes

 
Automated Jobs Analysis

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF SAP BACKGROUND JOBS	OPTIMIZED SAP SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY

Which jobs overlap with system peak times? Which jobs overload the CPU, RAM, WP? Which jobs are redundant or duplicated? Which jobs are or will soon become obsolete?
Which jobs are at risk of becoming invalid and why? Which jobs are experiencing an increase in duration, and what are the reasons behind it?
During system peaks, which jobs place the greatest burden on the system?
Which jobs were deleted from SAP systems? What alterations occurred to a job and its cause? Which jobs consistently fail and why?
Which jobs are repeatedly delayed and the reasons? Who updated which jobs and when?
