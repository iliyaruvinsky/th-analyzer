Common Errors
On this screen, you can update to the latest version of WordPress, as well as update your themes, plugins, and translations from the WordPress.org repositories.
If an update is available, you᾿ll see a notification appear in the Toolbar and navigation menu. Keeping your site updated is important for security. It also makes the internet a safer place for you and your readers.
WordPress
— Updating your WordPress installation is a simple one-click procedure: just
click on the “Update now” button
when you are notified that a new version is available. In most cases, WordPress will automatically apply maintenance and security updates in the background for you.
Themes and Plugins
— To update individual themes or plugins from this screen, use the checkboxes to make your selection, then
click on the appropriate “Update” button
. To update all of your themes or plugins at once, you can check the box at the top of the section to select all before clicking the update button.
Auto-updates can be enabled or disabled for WordPress major versions and for each individual theme or plugin. Themes or plugins with auto-updates enabled will display the estimated date of the next auto-update. Auto-updates depends on the WP-Cron task scheduling system.
Please note: Third-party themes and plugins, or custom code, may override WordPress scheduling.
This feature will create a temporary backup of a plugin or theme before it is upgraded. This backup is used to restore the plugin or theme back to its previous state if there is an error during the update process.
On systems with fewer resources, this may lead to server timeouts or resource limits being reached. If you encounter an issue during the update process, please create a support forum topic and reference
Rollback
in the issue title.
