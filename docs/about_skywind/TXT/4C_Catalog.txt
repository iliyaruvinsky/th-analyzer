Catalog
Alert Catalog
contains all available Exception Indicators, organized into
Categories
and
Subcategories
, e.g., Administration / System / BW / Application etc. While looking at any Exception Indicator in the
Alert Catalog
, you can observe the list of associated
Alert Templates
(Alert Template is a pre-configured alert).
Exception Indicator
(sometimes related as
EI
in the documentation) is an
ABAP Function Module
. EI’s should be parametrized to create single or multiple alerts. Consequently,
Alert Template
is a parameterized
Exception Indicator
that can be instantly activated and applied for a customer’s system/s. Both types of objects (
Exception Indicators
and
Alert Templates
) are coming as an integral part of
Skywind 4C™ Business Content
. Exception Indicator’s ABAP Function Module can not be modified by users, but only parameterized to create a desired number of Alerts.
For more info please refer to *** future section***.
