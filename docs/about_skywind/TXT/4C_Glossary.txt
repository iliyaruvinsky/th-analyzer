4C™ – Glossary
Skywind 4C™ alerting and monitoring service informs the recipients about events they were subscribed to or defining recipients dynamically (without a subscription), by analyzing results of notification’s content. Alerts are triggered to run according to their scheduling plan. Alerting mechanism as a whole, consists of the following components:
Exception Indicator
Alert Instance
Alert Template
(parameterized and pre-configured Alert Instance)
Alert Notification
Skywind 4C™ features hundreds of out-of-the-box Exception Indicators and Alert Templates. New Exceptions Indicators and Alert Templates are constantly being added to Alert packages and instantly become available to Skywind 4C™ clients.
Exception Indicator
Exception Indicator (sometimes addressed as
EI
in the documentation) is an ABAP Function Module that is built to trace and catch various events, occurring in SAP systems. Each EI has a structure, populated with a pool of fields, each one of which can serve as part of alert’s output and/or as one of alert’s parameters. Exception Indicators are proprietary ABAP functions, developed by Skywind, based on our expertise and knowledge of technical and business aspects of an SAP.
Note
Being an ABAP program
, from the technical perspective, new Exception Indicators can be developed by either Skywind development team, by client’s development team or by third party developers.
Alert Instance
Alert Instance (sometimes addressed as Alert or as AI in the documentation) is based on Exception Indicator. Converting Exception Indicator into Alert Instance requires to choose the appropriate Exception Indicator, adding parameters, recipients output fields and scheduling plan to it. Users can create an Alert instance from scratch, copy it from existing Alert Template as is or copy and apply customized parameters, relevant for specific business case.
Note
Multiple
Alert Templates and Alert Instances can be built, using a
single
Exception Indicator.
Alert Template
Alert Template is a concept similar to the concept of Alert Instance; the only difference is that Alert Instances are configured by users from scratch while Alert Templates are out-of-the-box parameterized Exception Indicator functions, customized to catch desirable SAP events. Alert Templates are a part of Skywind 4C™ pre-configured Business Content. They can be instantly copied by users and converted into Alert Instances.
Alert Notification
Alert Notification is a message, generated by Alert Instance and sent to the Alert recipients in case of event occurrence in an SAP system according to the Alert Instance parameters.
Notifications are sent via E-mail or as Text messages. E-mail notifications can be sent in various formats. For the detailed info, please refer to the
Wizard – Recipients
section of Skywind 4C™ documentation.
