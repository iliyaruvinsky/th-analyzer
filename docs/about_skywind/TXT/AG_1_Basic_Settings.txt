1. Basic Settings
This step is a starting point. First, choose Source system and Language. Click on the dropdowns to choose from the respective list of values.
Source System
is an SAP system, connected to the Skywind Analytical Platform. It represents an RFC connection to the specific SAP Instance.
Language
parameter sets the language of the text data:
Now you must choose the type of object. Use the dropdown to switch between
ABAP Table or View
and
Function module.
ABAP Table
or View
– you can choose any transparent table from the ABAP dictionary (e.g. KNA1, MARA etc.). You can also choose any database view, existing in ABAP dictionary, including ABAP Views, based on CDS Views (ABAP-enabled without parameters), HANA Calculation Views).
Note
Cluster tables
(like BSEG) are not supported in the current version of
AG
.
Function Module
– you can choose only from Function Modules that comply with Skywind 4C™ API. Alert Generator checks the compatibility of an FM with Skywind 4C™ API requirements.
After selecting the source type, enter the Table, View or Function Module name and click the
<Check
> button. The
<Check>
button will validate that the source object with such name exists in the source system:
After
AG
successfully validates the source’s existence, you should assign it to a
Category
and
Sub Category
from respective dropdown lists. The
Exception Indicator
(and reports, that will be built on top of it) will reside under this hierarchy in Alert Catalog:
Now click the
<Retrieve>
button to retrieve the metadata of the chosen source object.
Note
Description
of the chosen source is fetched automatically. You can change it once the metadata is retrieved.
If a
Source
was already used to create Alert(s) using AG, you will be informed about existing Alerts and Reports that were created on top of it:
