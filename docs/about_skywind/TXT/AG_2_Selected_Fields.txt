2. Selected Fields
In this tab you will define the pool of fields, which will form alert’s structure. The left frame holds
Available Fields
of the Source. Choose the desired fields and then click the
<Arrow>
button to move them to the
Used Fields
(in the right frame).
AG
allows adding
up to 100
fields to the Alert’s output structure. We recommend you to choose the most relevant fields and not all 100 fields to avoid further excessive efforts in configuring and supporting the Alerts during their life cycle.
Note
If in the future, there will be a necessity to extend the Exception Indicator structure by additional fields, it can be done by adding the fields and re-generating the resulting structures of the Exception Indicator.
After selecting fields from the list of
Available Fields,
you may see the higher number (even more than 100) of the fields in the
Used Fields
frame. That’s because
AG
is equipped with functions that automatically assign additional
Semantic
fields, according to the field’s domain for ABAP Table/View. In general, the
Semantics
allow:
Automatic enrichment by descriptions for the range of fields (e.g. domain KUNNR adds description for Customer, MATNR for Material etc.).  Assignment of Semantics will generate additional fields (e.g. for original field MATNR
🡪
MATNR_DESC field will be generated and added to the structure of
Exception Indicator
).
Automatic enrichment of Amounts (fields of “CURR” type) by additional fields that hold the Amounts, converted to Target currencies, chosen by the user. For instance: if currency conversion is applied to a field NETWR, additional field is automatically generated (e.g. for original field NETWR
🡪
NETWR_FOREIGN) and added to the structure of
Exception Indicator
).
Note
For the source type:
ABAP View
which is based on
HANA Calculation View
, the
Semantics
should be assigned manually, since for this
Source
the retrieved fields come without domains. It is used for conversion of alert parameters into inner format and for output of alert to convert inner values into output format.
You can navigate, sort and filter the tables using the headers, as anywhere else across the system:
<#of Fields>
button resides in the Header of each frame. Click on it to display the popover, containing fields overview by type. Here you can see how many fields of each type are available and select/deselect the fields of a specific type with a single click:
You can perform the following customizations for the
Used Fields:
