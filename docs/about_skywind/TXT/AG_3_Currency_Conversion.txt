3. Currency Conversion
Currency conversion can be performed for the Amount fields (field type = CURR)
at the  3
.
Currency Conversion
tab.
Here, as in the
2.Selected Fields
panel you can manage and choose from the list of
Available Fields
and move them to the
Used Fields
frame. Fields descriptions are open for change. If changed, it will automatically update the field’s description in all tabs.
Note
Currency Conversion functionality is not available if you use
Function Module
as a
Source
.
Amount (data type = CURR) fields which
do have
associated CUKY fields in the chosen
Source
will be processed by
AG
automatically. Here is how it done:
Fields of data type CURR are in most cases (but not always) linked to reference fields of data type CUKY. While CURR data type fields hold Amounts in currency, CUKY data type fields represent Currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY).
When this is the case,
AG
will automatically assign CUKY fields, found in the fetched Source to associated CURR fields.
Amount (data type = CURR) fields which
do not have
associated CUKY fields in the chosen Source, should be processed manually. It can be done, by choosing one of two options:
Assign the source currency by filling in the
Source Currency
field.
Assign the source currency by filling in
Ref. Cur. Field
field.
Amounts that were converted will be automatically paired by  <FIELD_NAME>_FOREIGN fields. The paired <FIELD_NAME>_FOREIGN fields will be added just below the original fields in the
2. Selected Fields
tab. For instance, the Amount field WTGBTR will be paired by WTGBTR_FOREIGN field. The <FIELD_NAME>_FOREIGN fields can be used as part of the reports output and as parameters.
Assigning a Source Currency from the list:
Assigning a Reference Currency:
Target currency can be selected from the list of Currencies. Once selected, it will be applied to all of the Currency fields, residing in the
Used Fields
section:
Date for Currency Conversion can be selected from the list of fields with Semantics
Date field
or chosen as
Current date
. The result of currency conversion will be available as additional field in alert’s output structure (e.g., for original field NETWR 🡪 NETWR_FOREIGN field will appear just under NETWR field in the
2.Selected Fields
tab):
