5. Key for Delta
All types of alerts and reports in
SkyAPS™
suite can run in either Full or Delta mode. In Delta mode, the alert will send only new data (delta) that was not sent in the previous notifications. To allow alerts to run in the Delta mode,
SkyAPS™
is required to keep the keys of the records that were previously sent. In this tab you will define the fields for such keys (e.g. you are interested to inform about the changes of material master data in MARA table. In this case you will select MATNR and AEDAT as key for Delta). Without completion of this setting alert cannot be executed in Delta mode.
Note
N
ot all types of alerts should run in Delta mode. It primarily depends on the alerting requirements. However, we still recommend setting Delta key fields, so you will have the flexibility to decide if some alerts based on the
Exception Indicator
will run in a Full/Delta mode.
To configure Delta for the alert structure, select fields that are relevant for the Delta key and move them from
Available Fields
to
Used Fields
