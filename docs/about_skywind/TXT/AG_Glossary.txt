Glossary
Skywind 4C™
alerting, reporting and monitoring platform informs recipients about events they were subscribed to or defines recipients dynamically (without a subscription), by analyzing results of notification’s content. Alerts are triggered to run according to their scheduling plan. Alerting mechanism as a whole, consists of the components, described in this document. Please refer to the Glossary table below for explanations of
Skywind 4C™ terminology:
Term
Abbreviations
Definition
Exception Indicato
r
EI
ABAP Function Module that is built to trace and catch various events occurring in SAP systems. Each EI has a structure, populated with a pool of fields, each one of which can serve as part of alert’s output and/or as one of alert’s parameters. Exception Indicators are proprietary ABAP functions, developed by Skywind, based on Skywind’s expertise and knowledge of technical and business aspects of an SAP.
Alert Instance
Alert, AI
Reporting or Alerting entity,
based on Exception Indicator. Converting
Exception Indicator
into
Alert Instance
requires choosing the appropriate
Exception Indicator
, adding parameters, recipients output fields and scheduling plan to it. Users can create an Alert Instance from scratch, copy it from existing Alert Template as is or copy and apply customized parameters, relevant for specific business cases. Multiple
Alert Instances
can be built, using a single
Exception Indicator.
Report
Report
is essentially an
Alert Instance
that is driven by a less operative scheduling plan (e.g. every Monday at 8:00 present to the users the list of events that occurred
during the last week
) rather than informing in real time about the event/problem that just happened.
Semantics
Semantics is a term used to describe complimentary entities, by which
Skywind 4C™ Alert Generator
automatically enriches reports and alerts.
The list of semantic enrichments include the following entities:
Field Descriptions
Currency Conversions
Condition
Conditions allow to compare between:
Values of 2 different fields
(e.g.
Simple Comparison:
Field A
>
Field B.
Complex Comparison
: Field A
>
Field B
and
Field C
<>
Field D
or
Field S
>=
Field A
and
Filed X
=
Field Z etc.).
Value of chosen field and constant value
(e.g. Field “DATUM”
>
01.01.2022)
Result of Comparison’s application:
The resulting data set in the report will be restricted accordingly.
Condition Component
Component
Component is a part of Condition which holds Comparisons – elements where the pair of field values are compared against each other or single field values are compared against a constant value
(e.g. values of Field “DATUM”
>
01.01.2022)
Condition Operator
Operator
SkyAPS™
SkyAPS™
An abbreviation for: Skywind Analytical Platform for SAP
Target Currency
A Currency, to which Amounts are converted from their original Currencies.
Source Entity
Source
An SAP Table/View/FM etc. Source is an entity, which is used in AG to build reports on.
Alert / Report Wizard
Wizard
A Wizard for alert/report customization (adding parameters, output fields, assigning recipients, scheduling, masking data etc.). Wizard is an essential element of
Skywind 4C™
reporting mechanism. AG redirects users to the Wizard once, all definitions of Exception Indicator are finished and successfully validated.
