Overview
Skywind 4C™ Alert Generator
(shortly
AG
) provides SAP functional teams, developers and end users with a no-code alternative to ABAP and BW reporting, dramatically increasing the simplicity, efficiency and speed of the process of reports creation and reports distribution.
For data distribution,
AG
possesses 8 different mechanisms, securely pushing mission critical info to the corporate recipients in real time via email and via text messages. The mechanisms for the distribution of reports are quite potent: among other things they allow  to distribute reports dynamically without a subscription or send different parts of report to different recipients, based on the report’s combinations of values.
Another prominent feature of
AG
is automated enrichment of the reports contexts by semantics like descriptions, currency conversions and more.
The
AG
is designed as a self-service module, allowing to instantly convert data, residing in a variety of SAP entities, into alerts and reports without complex configuration or back-end development, regardless of those entities being an SAP standard or Z* based (developed in house).
SAP sources that can be used in AG
The list of entities, which can be used as sources for
AG
:
ABAP Repository Tables
(e.g., KNA1, MARA or Z* developed, etc.)
ABAP Views
(any database view, existing in ABAP dictionary, including ABAP Views, based on HANA Calculation Views).
ABAP CDS
Views
ABAP Function Modules
(should be compliant with Skywind 4C™ API. AG will check the compatibility of an FM to Skywind 4C™ API requirements).
Files
(e.g., CSV, XLS etc.)
(this feature is currently in development)
ALV Reports
Principles and Architecture:
Skywind 4C™ Alert Generator
solution is an integral part of the
SkyAPS™
suite.
As such, it inherits all architectural principles of
SkyAPS™
suite and uses its
embedded mechanisms.
One of the most important features of
AG
is automatic code generation. While the user interacts with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, in the back-end
AG
automatically generates ABAP based Function Module, Structure, Macros, SQL sentences, Metadata. The resulting set, called
Exception Indicator
will serve as a base for multiple reports and alerts.
Note
As part of
SkyAPS™
architecture principles
,
all aforementioned  objects and entities: ABAP based Function Modules, Structures, Macros, SQL sentences, Metadata and Reports are generated on the Skywind platform. Client’s SAP systems remain intact.
How to create an Exception Indicator in AG?
The process of Exception Indicator creation consists of 6 simple steps. Some of them are mandatory, while others are optional and strictly depend on the specific reporting requirements. Here are the steps:
Fill up basic settings (e.g. Source SAP system, Language, Source Entity to report on)
Select fields for reports output
Select fields to serve as regular parameters for further restrictions of fetched reporting data (if necessary)
Perform currency conversion (if necessary)
Define special parameters (to define enquired history depth etc.)
Select key fields for Delta (incremental) reporting
Define conditions (comparison between the fields or constant values)
Add documentation (if necessary)
