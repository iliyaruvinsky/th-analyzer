Date and Time Parameters
Alerts can be parametrized using dozens of fields that derive from SAP tables. Alongside with them 4C™ provides special external Date and Time parameters that are used in majority of Best Practice and Alert Generator based alerts. Using those parameters you can define time intervals for monitoring.
Date and Time Parameters
are NOT coming from the pool of the source structure fields, and should be entered manually. These are proprietary parameters used in customizations within 4C™ system.
Only
DATE_REF_FLD
originates from the the source structure.
BACKDAYS
–
is used to monitor event’s history.
BACKDAYS
is a single choice parameter, defining history range from now backwards. To monitor events that can happen today – set
BACKDAYS = 0
, to catch events starting from today 1 week back – set
BACKDAYS = 7
etc. Always check if the
BACKDAYS
parameter is available in the configured alert and use it to validate the past events. The default value is always set to be today – (
BACKDAYS = 0
).
BACKDAYS
is based on the date field, assigned with
DATE_REF_FLD
parameter.
FORWDAYS
– is similar to
BACKDAYS
parameter but defines monitoring range of the future events. It is used in some alerts, that contain business logic with future events (e.g. future employee retirement/accommodation etc.)
DATE_REF_FLD
–
Date Reference Field – is used to select date field, used by
BACKDAYS
parameter.
Example:
if you select parameter values
DATE_REF_FLD = AUDAT
(Document Date) and
BACKDAYS = 7 ,
an Alert will fetch the data for the last week according to history of AUDAT (e.g. sy-datum – AUDAT).
DURATION
– is used to
monitor time interval, e.g. for processing time.
DURATION
is an interval parameter and is used to answer the question “how many days/hours/minutes/seconds have passed since the  specific event?” This parameter always works together with
DURATION_UNIT
parameter.  For
DURATION
parameter you can set single values, ranges etc. In most Alerts you have both
DURATION
related and
BACKDAYS
parameter. So you must use them together.
DURATION_UNIT –
is used for defining time intervals:
D
– Days
H
– Hours
M
– Minutes.  Value
F
is used if you want to monitor specific day in the past (instead of using Backdays = X for all days since day X).
Examples of  Parameters Usage for  General Purpose Alerts
You can combine some or all of the aformentioned parameters to monitor a specific time frame. Below are examples of several use-cases:

Examples of  Parameters Usage for  Job Related Alerts
Jobs in SAP systems may run for a long period of time and it’s important to monitor them to avoid excessive system resources consumption by long running Jobs.
There are several Alerts (EIs) for monitor of  these cases. The default Date & Time Reference Fields are related to Job Start Date/Time and in most cases aren’t expected to be overriden. To catch long running jobs you should set a threshold using Duration and Duration_Unit parameters and set Backdays parameters for a specific date frame (usually today or today + yesterday).
1. Fetch all Jobs that Run Over 3 hours today, based on EI’s default date field:
