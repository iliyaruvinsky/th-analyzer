Documentation on Menus

This screen is used for managing your navigation menus.
Menus can be displayed in locations defined by your theme, even used in sidebars by adding a “Navigation Menu” widget on the
Widgets
screen. If your theme does not support the navigation menus feature (the default themes, Twenty Twenty and Twenty Twenty-One, do), you can learn about adding this support by following the documentation link to the side.
From this screen you can:
Create, edit, and delete menus
Add, organize, and modify individual menu items
The menu management box at the top of the screen is used to control which menu is opened in the editor below.
To edit an existing menu,
choose a menu from the dropdown and click Select
If you have not yet created any menus,
click the ’create a new menu’ link
to get started
You can assign theme locations to individual menus by
selecting the desired settings
at the bottom of the menu editor. To assign menus to all theme locations at once,
visit the Manage Locations tab
at the top of the screen.
Each navigation menu may contain a mix of links to pages, categories, custom URLs or other content types. Menu links are added by selecting items from the expanding boxes in the left-hand column below.
Clicking the arrow to the right of any menu item
in the editor will reveal a standard group of settings. Additional settings such as link target, CSS classes, link relationships, and link descriptions can be enabled and disabled via the Screen Options tab.
Add one or several items at once by
selecting the checkbox next to each item and clicking Add to Menu
To add a custom link,
expand the Custom Links section, enter a URL and link text, and click Add to Menu
To reorganize menu items,
drag and drop items with your mouse or use your keyboard
. Drag or move a menu item a little to the right to make it a submenu
Delete a menu item by
expanding it and clicking the Remove link
Screen elements
Some screen elements can be shown or hidden by using the checkboxes.			Expand or collapse the elements by clicking on their headings, and arrange them by dragging their headings or by clicking on the up and down arrows.
