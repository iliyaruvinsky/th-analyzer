Role’s Assigned Users & Transactions – Managing Reporting Instance versions
When a new
Reporting Instance
is created, the system automatically assigns Version
00
to its
Processing Task
. Once created, it will appear in the reporting hierarchy (in the left frame), while the right frame will display two blocks: Parameters and Scheduling Output. Now you can:
Delete Version 00
Schedule Execution frequency and Next run
Run reporting instance online (Using
Run Now
option)
Save to
Ready
(will not run – parked)
Save to
Scheduled
(will run as scheduled)
Once the version is saved, you can edit it at any time, by re-scheduling, changing status; run it, delete or create a new version.
Note
If you anticipate that the report will return a lot of data (e.g. tens of thousands of results), we recommend you to schedule it to run in offline mode. Don’t use
Run now
mode to avoid timeout errors.
After you save a version, it will be displayed in the Reporting Hierarchy on the left, under the chosen status (
Ready
or
Scheduled
).
Status: Ready
Click on a
Processing Task
under the
Ready
node of the hierarchy to manage the task and display its parameters. From the right frame you can delete it, create a new version and move to schedule. A task in
Ready
status will not run until you change it to a
Scheduled
status:
Status: Scheduled
Click on a
Processing Task
under the
Scheduled
node of the hierarchy to manage the task and display its parameters. From the right frame you can delete it, create a new version, run online, update, schedule or move to a
Ready
status. A task in
Scheduled
status will run according to a schedule:
Status: Active
If a
Processing Task
is running, the resulting
Processing Task
will be displayed under the
Active
node of the report hierarchy.
Click on a
Processing Task
under the
Active
node of the hierarchy to display the task’s parameters. From the right frame you can cancel the execution by clicking the
<Stop>
button:
Status: Cancelled
If a
Processing Task
run was cancelled (either by user or due to some problem in a system), the resulting
Processing Task
will be displayed under the
Cancelled
node of the report hierarchy:
Status: Finished
If a
Processing Task
has finished its run successfully, the resulting
Processing Task
will be displayed under the
Finished
node of the report hierarchy.
Click on a
Processing Task
under the
Finished
node of the hierarchy to display the task’s parameters and output data. From the right frame you can create a new version, delete existing version, schedule a new run or look at the collected data by pressing a <
Show Report>
button:
The lower right block of the right frame displays the chart with a history of
Processing Task
runs. To drill down to detailed info click on a point on the chart or the
<
Show Report>
button:
Click the
<
Expand>
button to open the chart in full screen. The default time range is 5 days before and after the chosen
Processing Task’s
run. To adjust the first and last days on the time axis, use the selector:
By clicking on a value on the chart the
Run’s data
popover will be displayed. From there you can export the metadata to Excel or display report’s data:
