Wizard – Format
Alert’s structures contain multiple output fields. At the
Format
section you will choose the fields which will construct Alert’s output. You can arrange output fields in the desired order and edit original field’s descriptions:
To add fields to Alert’s output sorting, click on the
<+Add field>
button, select a desired field from the dropdown list at the left side and choose sorting order (Ascending/Descending) from the dropdown list at the right side. You can choose multiple fields for initial sorting of the output:
To manage the sorting fields order or delete the fields, choose them by checking the checkboxes and then click on the
<Move up> / <Move down>
or
<Delete>
buttons respectively:
You can filter the list of sorting fields by clicking on table’s header. To remove the filter you can either use the same header or the dedicated button at the right side:
The lower part of the screen is used to manage the fields, included in the output. Here you can choose fields from the
Available fields
panel and move them to the
Used
fields
panel. Fields in the
Used
fields
panel will construct alert’s output. You can move the fields between the panels using the
<Arrows>
buttons:
You can sort and filter the fields list using the header of the table, in both panels –
Available fields
and
Used fields
:
Use the
<Move Up>
and
<Move Down>
buttons to set the order of the output fields. Alternatively you can drag and drop the fields inside the
Used Fields
panel to get the desired field’s order:
You can customize fields descriptions so they will appear with custom names, instead of the default ones:
Data Masking
Data Masking functionality is used to mask sensitive data (e.g. user’s personal data). Skywind 4C allows
to mask any fields of any alert
in a flexible and manageable way. This feature is useful when you:
Have to comply with
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
or any other regulations that demand to mask sensitive data.
Want to mask specific fields, which contain sensitive data.
The masking functionality is applicable to all fields in all alerts – the actual data will be replaced by random characters both inside Skywind 4C™ interface and in the generated output email and attachments. Once a field is masked, all users (except Administrators) will see the data masked, unless you explicitely define (using the
Wizard – Authorizations
) who will be authorized to see the actual values, providing the users/recipients with the appropriate permission.
To select Data Masking for a field, first click on the
<Field Metadata>
button:
Then check the
<Mask data>
checkbox:
Once you open the Alert’s output, the masked fields will be marked with a special icon and the data will be displayed as following:
