Wizard – Parameters
In order to catch specific event type, in most cases Alert Instances must be parameterized (restricted by specific parameter values). Every Alert Instance has its own pool of parameters, based on the ABAP Function Module behind the Alert. In Skywind professional language, ABAP Function Module behind the alert is called:
“Exception Indicator”
while alerts are being addressed as either:
“Alert Instances”
or just
“Alerts”
.
Both, Exception Indicators and Alert Instances may have parameters, restricted by specific values. While Exception Indicator restrictions are visible, but not changeable, Alert Instance restrictions can be altered by users, who’s been authorized to do it. The key features are described in the table below:
Exception Indicator restrictions
Alert Instance restrictions
Built-in parameters, can’t be changed by user when creating/modifying Alert Instance
Totally adjustable by authorized user, any combinations can be applied when creating/modifying Alert Instance
Not all of the Exception Indicators have built-in restrictions
All Alert Instances have available alert restrictions fields, used for parametrization when creating/modifying Alert Instance
Each combination of parameters tracks and catches unique event types. Combinations of parameters can be stored in layers, allowing a single Alert Instance to catch different event types. Parameters inside a layer are treated with logical
AND
, while different layers are treated with logical
OR:
In case you’ll need more detailed info about parameter fields, switch to
<Expert View>:
Choose parameters from the list by checking the respective checkboxes and then clicking
<OK>
button:
Choose a
Condition
operator from the dropdown list, set the value(s) as
Initial
or assign
From
and
To
values (for a single value condition – only
From
field should be filled). Longest length of entered value should not exceed 45 symbols.
Notes about each condition operator are listed in the table below:
Condition operatorы
Notes
Equal to
Not equal to
These parameters are case sensitive.
No wildcards are accepted. They are processed as regular values.
In case of number types, they can be proceesed in the same way using different formats. E.g. 3.999 = 0.3999E+1
Date format (if not specified explicitly) is internal (YYYYMMDD).
If specified external format exists, it depends on logon user settings (dd.mm.yyy, dd/mm/yyyy, mm.dd.yyyy etc).
Time format works similarly: if not specified explicitly, it is internal (hhmmss).
If specified external format exists, it depends on logon user settings (e.g. hh:mm:ss)
Greater than
Less than
Great than or equal to
Less than or equal to
All notes relevant to Equal/Not equal to operators are also applicable here.
Comparison results depend on data type.
Numerical comparisons are complaint to regular mathematical conventions, e.g the result is TRUE when 9.99 < 10, -9.99>-10 etc.
Character strings are compared based on ASCII code of characters:
Special symbols are less than numbers
Numbers are less then alphabetical characters
Upper case characters are less than corresponding lower case characters
English characters are less than nathional characters
Examples:
abc GT ABC -> true
ABC GT 123 -> true
aBC GT Abc -> true
123 GT 234 -> false
1234 GT 123 -> true
-3.999 GT -4 -> false
Between (range)
Not in range
All notes relevant to Greater than/Less than/Greater or equal to/Less than or equal to operators are also applicable here.
The range is defined based on: FROM is Greater or Equal to Value 1 and TO  is Less or Equal to Value 2.
In case when the FROM or TO value is ommited, the initial value for specific data type is refered:
Number – 0
String – blank ‘ ‘
Date – 00000000
Time – 000000
Contains
Does not contain
These parameters are case sensitive and applicable only to string and date values. Date formats are processed exactly like with other operators.
Wildcard usage in Skywind 4C™ is similar to usage of such in SAP reports and systems: “*” – string containing any number of symbols “+” – single symbol.
You can use “*” wildcard to detect strings based on pattern, that os located at the start, middle or end of a string:
Text that begins with “XXXX” – the pattern should be XXXX
*
Text that contains “XXXX” anywhere – the pattern should be
*
XXXX
*
Text that ends with “XXXX” – the pattern should be
*
XXXX
Blank space ” ” is processed as a regular symbol.
E.g. the following expressions are not equal:
*
XXXX
*
*
XXXX
*
*
XXXX
*
*
XX XX
*
*
XXXX
*
When parameter value itself contains “*” or “+” symbols, you should put “#” before them to ensure correct processing of the parameter. E.g.
*
#*
*
#*
*
->  ABC*xyz*123
You can also use wildcards combinations.
E.g.
ABC
*
abc
* ,
A
+
B
+
C
+
abc
*
,
+
_
*
_
+
Instead of manual input, you can
Paste values from clipboard
for selected parameters.
To delete parameters you can check the checkboxes against the selected ones and then click
<Delete selected restrictions>
or
<Delete>
button against a specific parameter:
A condition can be copied by clicking on the respective button. This may be useful if you e.g. create several conditions for the same parameter, be it 2 layers or complex parameters including/excluding different value ranges:
As anywhere across the system you can sort and filter the list of restrictions using the table header:
In addition to the
Parameters
based on the Alert/Exception Indicator fields, there are External Date and Time parameters, that are relatively agnostic and are relevant for most alert types. Please refer to
Date and Time Parameters
section for additional details.
