Today I'm starting a series of blogs, related to what I do in SAP@GenAI domains. 
Last year I've made (I think) some progress, learning, adopting then personally developing the necessary entetprise related framework that gets the best out of SAP with the help of genAI (LLM based AI). 
I'm currently do it in a multichannel manner. On the one side of this gold coin, I provide  services and develop products for the enterprises while the other side of the coin is my goal of transforming Skywind Software to become Agentic based development company. I see the dynamics and the response of the enterprises I'm working for, to this fundamental shift (one side of the "gold coin"), analyze it, learning and teaching at the same time all good and professional peers of mine, standing in a middle between the group of professionals I'm working for and the group of professionals who develop Skywind platform.

It's interesting to contemplate how these 2 domains combine and how natural it feels and flows.
None of my posts will be written by a machine - this is the core principle of this journey. I'm intentionally doing it as part of the strategy. I love what I do with machines, but I also love to express my thoughts and observations by myself, so I hope this blog will be fun, instructive and a bit surprising.
Your responses will tell me if I'm moving in the right direction.
Not too long the posts will be. They will provide a critical aspects and important nuances to those, who wishes to enter the genAI domain and learn about it, acquiring practical knowledge to become a better professional.
I'm aware that I'm probably one of many in this field but I will try my luck anyway, because I follow my professional life credo: "“Better to try and regret, than not to try and regret.”
Stay tuned.

Alerts have been a major parts of our lives in Israel lately. 
They have helped us protect ourselves, find safety and take shelter during the missile attacks.
Because Alerts - at the right time - can save lives!
Alerts matter-> they give us time to act, stay ahead and avoid bigger trouble later.

Its not different in our SAP world. 
In my recent webinar, I had the opportunity to share with the organizations in South Africa, how  we partnered with Sky wind software to transform our SAP operations post S/4 Hana Go live, from dealing with daily disruptions to proactively preventing them. 

Before Sky wind:

* We were reacting to issues too late
* Manual Monitoring - was too late, too little and overwhelming

After Sky wind:
* We build proactive alerts that detect issues before they spread
* We moved from fire fighting to fire proofing our processes.

Just like real-life alerts protect us, these SAP alerts help protect our processes, data, and peace of mind. 😇 

Let’s keep building systems that protect, enable, and evolve with us.

Thank you to everyone who joined this session . It was great to share our story.

🚨 AI Agents vs. Traditional Apps: The "Apps Apocalypse"? 🚨

Tech leaders Bill McDermott (ServiceNow) and Satya Nadella (Microsoft) predict a massive shift in enterprise software: AI agents could soon replace many traditional business applications. Their vision? AI agents will handle business logic and data tasks across platforms, making many standalone apps obsolete. This could mean fewer apps, more automation, and a new era of innovation-but also big changes for companies heavily invested in current software.

Are we ready for this "Agent Era"? Share your thoughts!

הי, רבים היום מתעניינים בהתפתחות של מודלי LLM ונשפכים טונות של מידע, כך שכבר היום יש TMI ואנשים לא מצליחים לעקוב אחר המושגים, הפיצ'רים והטכנולוגיות. אישית – לא ראיתי קצב התפתחות טכנולוגי שכזה מעולם . רבים מאנשים שאני פוגש בחיי המקצועיים (וגם אישיים), משתמשים בכלים הנפוצים היום בצורה יחסית פשוטה. רובם היו שמחים להעמיק את השימוש אך ללא "בזבוז" שעות על לימוד התורה. אני החלטתי (ולא בשביל ה Personal Glory) לפרסם מדי פעם דברים בנושא, שנראים לי חמים אך לא ברורים מספיק. היום אדבר (ממש קצר) על ה Model Context Protocol. כל מי שמשתמש בכלי LLM יודע את זיכרונם הקצר – מ Prompt ל Prompt הם לא זוכרים דבר וגם באותו Prompt הם מתחילים להתבלבל בצורה מאוד יפה אם האורך שלו עולה על סף מסוים (שאף פעם לא ידוע מראש). יש טכניקות רבות לשפר את התגובות אבל Anthropic באמת הבריקו עם ה MCP. הנה לכם קצת ממנו (בסוף ה Intro שלי יצא יותר ארוך מהתוכן שאני מפרסם אז אסיים כאן):
