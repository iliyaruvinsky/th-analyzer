template_name: quantitative_alert
version: "1.2"
description: |
  Use this template for alerts that produce numeric, measurable outputs:
  - Financial amounts (losses, gains, exposures)
  - Counts (records, transactions, users)
  - Percentages and ratios
  - Aggregatable data that can be sliced by dimensions

# =============================================================================
# KEY FINDINGS - MUST BE FIRST (SCANNABLE UPFRONT SUMMARY)
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Key findings upfront for quick scanning
# Format: Clean, simple, minimal bold - focus on readability

key_findings:
  position: first
  principle: "Key findings upfront - scannable at a glance"
  max_length: "Half page max"

  required_subsections:

    # 1. Key Metrics Table (Required)
    - section: metrics_table
      format: two_column_table
      rows: 4
      content: |
        Quick-glance metrics. Clean format, minimal bold.
        4 rows: Records, Period, Total Value, Severity
      example: |
        ## Key Findings

        | Metric | Value |
        |--------|-------|
        | Records | 1,274 billing documents |
        | Period | Nov 19-27, 2025 (9 days) |
        | Total Value | ~$7.9 million USD |
        | Severity | MEDIUM |
      note: "Clean format. No excessive bold. Include context in values."

    # 2. Critical Discovery (Required)
    - section: critical_discovery
      format: heading_with_bullets
      bullet_style: "•"
      max_bullets: 3
      content: |
        The single most important finding that requires attention.
        Use bullet points (•) not dashes.
      example: |
        ## Critical Discovery

        **Credit Memo to One-Time Customer:**
        • 167.8 million TZS (~$67K USD) credit memo issued to "One time customer for Tanzania"
        • Credit memos to unidentified one-time customers are a classic fraud indicator
        • Requires immediate investigation: authorization, supporting docs, original invoice
      note: "Use • bullets. Entity name + amount in bold heading."

    # 3. Concentration Pattern (Required)
    - section: concentration_pattern
      format: single_table_with_note
      columns: [entity, records, percentage]
      max_rows: 4
      content: |
        Single table showing main concentration pattern.
        No Risk column - keep it clean.
        Add closing observation as plain text after table.
      example: |
        ## Concentration Pattern

        | Sales Org | Records | % of Value |
        |-----------|---------|------------|
        | TZ01 (Tanzania) | 336 (26%) | **92%** |
        | KE01 (Kenya) | 411 (32%) | 3% |
        | SA01 (South Africa) | 314 (25%) | 4% |

        All top 10 customers by value are from Tanzania.
      note: "One table. Add insight note after. Bold only the critical percentage."

# =============================================================================
# BUSINESS CONTEXT SECTION - AFTER EXECUTIVE BRIEF
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Help reader understand WHY this alert matters BEFORE seeing data
# Provides orientation - reader needs context to interpret the numbers
# Keep it SHORT - 4 subsections max

business_context:
  position: after_executive_brief
  principle: "Context before detailed data - reader needs orientation after seeing brief"
  max_length: "Half a page"

  required_subsections:

    # 1. Business Purpose (Required)
    - section: business_purpose
      format: blockquote_paragraph
      source: explanation_file
      content: |
        A 2-3 sentence business-focused explanation of what this alert monitors.
        Derived from Explanation_* file. Must speak BUSINESS language, not technical.
        Answer: "What business risk does this alert help detect?"
      example: |
        > **Business Purpose:** This alert identifies sales transactions where products
        > were sold below their cost price, resulting in direct financial loss. It helps
        > detect pricing errors, unauthorized discounts, or potential fraud schemes
        > where employees may be favoring specific customers.
      note: "MANDATORY - Must be derived from Explanation_* file"

    # 2. What This Alert Monitors (1-2 sentences)
    - section: what_it_monitors
      format: single_paragraph
      content: |
        Technical description of the monitoring logic in plain language.
        Derived from Code_* file.
      example: "Compares NETWR (net value) against WAVWR (cost) in sales order line items."

    # 3. Why It Matters (table format)
    - section: why_it_matters
      format: two_column_table
      columns: [risk_type, business_impact]
      max_rows: 3
      example: |
        | Risk Type | Business Impact |
        | Revenue Leakage | Every flagged item = money lost |
        | Pricing Control Gap | No hard stop preventing below-cost sales |

    # 4. Interpreting the Findings (table format)
    - section: interpreting_findings
      format: three_column_table
      columns: [pattern, legitimate_cause, red_flag]
      max_rows: 3
      note: "Help reader distinguish normal vs suspicious"
