read ALL docs in: C:\Users\USER\Desktop\tha-new\docs\th-context\analysis-rules

now lets do it again but even more thoroughly. follow step by step all commands below:

after you done with this - do again this:

1. go over all documents in "documentation" or "docs" folder and in a root folder and check for: inconsistencies, redundancies, loops, circle references, duplicates and other errors.
2. go over backend, frontend and integration folders and check for: inconsistencies, redundancies, loops, circle references, duplicates, contradictions and other discrepancies or errors. 
3. REMEMBER - the documentation context and each application MUST BE 100% ALIGNED to allow LLM flawless development process.
4. make sure that your above promises about 100% inevitability of going thru this validation will really 100% work that way. CHECK EVERY DOCUMENT in "documents" folder and in a root folder
5. Put all artifacts that are about to be deleted because of irrelevance, inconsistency, redundancy or outdatedness into a new "JUNK" folder (create it) and let me overview them before I decide to delete them. Keep the "JUNK" folder all the time. Fill it up during the project progress.

also do the following:
Verifying referenced files actually exist
Checking if called methods are implemented
Comparing ALL definitions of the same thing
Testing if "fixes" were applied everywhere
Build an automated validation script to catch these issues (if NOT exists)

ROUND 1: Documentation audit

ROUND 2: Check backend schema consistency

ROUND 2: Backend + Frontend code audit

ROUND 2: Verify all database models have schemas

ROUND 2: Check service layer imports

ROUND 2: Verify config/settings consistency

ROUND 2: Check for dead code/unused imports

ROUND 2: Update audit report

ROUND 3: Deep validation check

ROUND 3: Run validation script

ROUND 3: Check database migrations

ROUND 3: Verify llm_handover.md accuracy

create a comprehensive report of the findings and of the actions you executed. 

YOU WILL DO IT TIME AFTER TIME IN A ROW UNTIL I TELL YOU TO STOP. ITS GONNA BE A 10 TIMES CIRCLE TO CLEAN UP YOUR SHIT WITH WHICH YOU POLLUTED THE CONTEXT AND NOW EVEN CAN'T FIND A WORKING VERSION OF THE TOOL.



i'm leaving you. you lost your mind. Update llm_handover with the context to continue with other agent in a new chat.
